# word-image-similarity
School project for implementing SpottingNet (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01374401/document)


# TODO
- compare errors of regressor and classifier
- compare correlation between layers of ResNet trained on ImageNet
- build the whole database: maybe try to build it batches by batches during training
